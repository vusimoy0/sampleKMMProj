# Food 2 Fork
This is a sample Kotlin Multiplatform project Mobile app that

The app uses the following tech stack:
* Kotlin  + Jetpack Compose
* Swift UI
* Ktor as the web framework for both platforms
* SQLDelight as the chaching layer for both platforms
* MVI Architecture. 

On the iOS side of things, we use cocoapods to manage dependencies. On Android, Gradle. 

The app was done as a part of a course on codingwithmitch.com and is just a reference project for the next couple of KMM projects to get a feel for the tech.
